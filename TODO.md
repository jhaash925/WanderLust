- [x] Update public/css/style.css: Add modern styles including shadows, better typography, hover effects, and enhanced responsiveness.
- [x] Add review scroll arrow buttons and scroll functionality.
- [x] Fix scroll padding to allow full scrolling to extreme left and right reviews.
- [x] Add button state management to disable/enable scroll buttons when at start or end.
